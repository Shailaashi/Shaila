            </h1>
            <p>
               I'm Shaila—a curious maker, crafter, closet maximalist and a poteto. 
               This blog is a snapshot of all the things that make me tick, and things that i usually spend my time on: bold 
               outfits, beautiful code, random stuffs, handmade chaos, and everyday wins 
               that make life spark a little brighter.

            </h1>
            <p>
                When I'm not doing stuffs, and i want some pain in the head, I’m creating algorithms.
                I share beginner-friendly programming tutorials, quirky 
                side projects, and tips for surviving debugging meltdowns 
                with grace (and snacks). Whether you’re a curious newbie 
                or a caffeinated dev, you’re welcome here.

                🎨 Handcrafted Joy
            </h1>
            <p>
                Crochet. Fuxzzt wire. ribbons. Paper. Paint. I love making things 
                with my hands that didn’t exist before. You’ll find 
                DIY tutorials, behind-the-scenes project messes, and 
                reflections on what handcrafting teaches us about 
                patience, precision, and imperfection.

                📚 Reading, Because Words Heal
            </h1>
            <p>
                Writing, for me, isn’t just craft—it’s connection. 
                I journal to understand, blog to share, and occasionally 
                scribble poetry that never leaves my drafts folder. This 
                space is where I write from the heart, not just the 
                grammar handbook.

            </h1>
            <p>
                Faith is a cornerstone of my life. Here, I’ll share 
                devotionals, reflections, and honest thoughts about 
                walking with God in a world that’s equal parts chaotic 
                and beautiful. I'm not perfect, but I'm 
                learning what grace really means.

                🎬 Cinema Therapy
            </h1>
            <p>
                Movies are my escape, inspiration, and sometimes free 
                therapy. You’ll find posts about films that made me cry, 
                think, or laugh like a maniac—plus reflections on 
                storytelling and character arcs that mirror real-life 
                struggles and triumphs.
