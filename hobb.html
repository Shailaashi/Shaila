                <h3>Photography</h3>
                <p>
                    I love capturing moments and scenery. Photography
                    allows me to express my creativity and connect with
                    the world around me.

                <p>
                    Exploring new cultures and landscapes inspires me.
                    Traveling gives me fresh perspectives and fuels my
                    creativity.

                <h3>Reading</h3>
                <p>
                    Books are a great source of knowledge and
                    relaxation. I enjoy reading fiction,
                    self-improvement, and tech-related books.
                    Getting lost in a good book is my escape. 
                    It’s more than just entertainment—it’s a 
                    chance to live a hundred different lives, 
                    feel deeply, and think in new ways.

                <h3>DIY Crafts</h3>
                <p>
                    I enjoy making things with my hands, 
                    from home decor to personalized gifts. 
                    There's a sense of satisfaction in creating 
                    something unique and useful.

                <h3>Calligraphy</h3>
                <p>
                    There’s something calming about watching 
                    ink flow from my pen in elegant strokes. 
                    quite Calming and Stressful as Well.

                <p>
                    I collect little things that mean something 
                    to me. Each piece has a story or a feeling 
                    attached, and seeing them all together feels like 
                    looking at a timeline of my soul. thse memories 
                    entangled to each thigs that i collect.
